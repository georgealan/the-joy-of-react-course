# Search Form

In this exercise, we'll build an inline search form, Here, you'll find the raw HTML code that produces the UI we want. Your job is to convert it to JSX, so that it can be used in React.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* The UI should match the screenshot in the assets folder.
* No errors should be shown in the Result pane.
* No warnings should be logged in the Console pane.
  * Note: the console isn't cleared automatically when the warnings are fixed. You can refresh the Preview pane with the  icon.
