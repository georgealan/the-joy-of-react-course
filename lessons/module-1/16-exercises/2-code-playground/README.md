# Exercises Extract components: Creating a “Button” component

We have two <button> elements. Create a Button component, and use it to render both buttons.

Acceptance Criteria:

* A brand-new Button component should be created and used for both buttons
* Each Button instance should be able to set its own text content, as well as choose a text/border color. It's up to you to decide how you want to structure this!
