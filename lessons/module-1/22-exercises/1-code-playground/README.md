# Exercises: Avatar selection

We have an application which displays multiple avatars the user can select from.

The Avatar component is already wired up, but it's being rendered manually, copy/pasted with different data. Let's update it to use the tricks we've learned in these lessons!

Acceptance criteria:

* You should create an array that holds the data needed for all avatars.
* That array should be iterated over, creating an <Avatar /> element for each item in the array.
* There should be no key warnings in the console.
